# Music-Store-SQL-Queries

This project explores a music company's database using SQL. It investigates employee titles, invoice distribution, top customers, and top Rock music artists. Queries reveal the most senior employee, countries with the most invoices, top invoice amounts, the city with the highest revenue, the biggest spending customer, and the top 10 Rock music artists by track count.
